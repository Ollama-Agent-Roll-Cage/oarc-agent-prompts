Explanation:
In this updated code, we have added two new agents, Agent 7 (Temperature Measurement) and Agent 8 (Radiation Detection), which require infrared and ultraviolet sensors respectively. We have added the available infrared and ultraviolet sensors to the cosmic_knowledge_base dictionary.

The select_payloads method now selects the most suitable payloads for the new agents, including the FLIR Lepton 3.5 infrared sensor for Agent 7 (Temperature Measurement) and the ML8511 ultraviolet sensor for Agent 8 (Radiation Detection).

The selected payloads for all agents are printed using the print_payloads method, including the new infrared and ultraviolet sensors.

Task 2: Select Infrared and Ultraviolet Sensors for Each Agent
In this task, we need to select the most suitable infrared and ultraviolet sensors for each agent. We have two agents that require these sensors: Agent 7 (Temperature Measurement) and Agent 8 (Radiation Detection).

Based on the cosmic knowledge base data, we have the following infrared and ultraviolet sensors available:

Infrared sensors: ["FLIR Lepton 3.5", "MLX90640", "AMG8833"]
Ultraviolet sensors: ["ML8511", "GUVA-S12SD", "VEML6070"]
We need to select one infrared sensor for Agent 7 (Temperature Measurement) and one ultraviolet sensor for Agent 8 (Radiation Detection).

Explanation:
The select_payloads method now selects the most suitable sensors for Agent 7 (Temperature Measurement) and Agent 8 (Radiation Detection). It selects the first sensor from the list of available sensors for each agent. The selected payloads for all agents are printed using the print_payloads method.

We can modify the select_payloads method to select different sensors based on specific criteria or requirements. For example, we can select the most accurate sensor or the sensor with the highest resolution.

To modify the select_payloads method, we can add additional logic to select the sensors based on specific criteria. For example, we can add a criteria parameter to the select_payloads method and use it to select the sensors.

Here's an example of how we can modify the select_payloads method to select the sensors based on accuracy:

def select_payloads(self, criteria="accuracy"):
    # ...
    if criteria == "accuracy":
        # Select the most accurate sensor for Agent 7
        infrared_sensors = self.cosmic_knowledge_base["payloads"]["sensors"]["infrared"]
        infrared_sensors.sort(key=lambda x: x["accuracy"], reverse=True)
        self.cosmic_knowledge_base["agentPayloads"]["Agent 7 (Temperature Measurement)"] = [infrared_sensors[0]]
        
        # Select the most accurate sensor for Agent 8
        ultraviolet_sensors = self.cosmic_knowledge_base["payloads"]["sensors"]["ultraviolet"]
        ultraviolet_sensors.sort(key=lambda x: x["accuracy"], reverse=True)
        self.cosmic_knowledge_base["agentPayloads"]["Agent 8 (Radiation Detection)"] = [ultraviolet_sensors[0]]
In this example, we add a criteria parameter to the select_payloads method and use it to select the sensors based on accuracy. We sort the list of sensors in descending order based on accuracy and select the most accurate sensor for each agent.

We can modify the select_payloads method to select the sensors based on other criteria such as resolution, cost, or power consumption.

Task 3: Select Magnetometers for Detecting Magnetic Fields
In this task, we need to select the most suitable magnetometers for detecting magnetic fields. We have two agents that require these sensors: Agent 9 (Magnetic Field Measurement) and Agent 10 (Geomagnetic Survey).

Based on the cosmic knowledge base data, we have the following magnetometers available:

Magnetometers: ["HMR3600", "HMC5983", "AK8963"]
We need to select one magnetometer for Agent 9 (Magnetic Field Measurement) and one magnetometer for Agent 10 (Geomagnetic Survey).

Explanation:
The select_payloads method now selects the most suitable magnetometers for Agent 9 (Magnetic Field Measurement) and Agent 10 (Geomagnetic Survey). It selects the first magnetometer from the list of available magnetometers for Agent 9 and the second magnetometer for Agent 10. The selected payloads for all agents are printed using the print_payloads method.

We can modify the select_payloads method to select different magnetometers based on specific criteria or requirements. For example, we can select the most accurate magnetometer or the magnetometer with the highest resolution.

To modify the select_payloads method, we can add additional logic to select the magnetometers based on specific criteria. For example, we can add a criteria parameter to the select_payloads method and use it to select the magnetometers.

Here's an example of how we can modify the select_payloads method to select the magnetometers based on accuracy:

def select_payloads(self, criteria="accuracy"):
    # ...
    if criteria == "accuracy":
        # Select the most accurate magnetometer for Agent 9
        magnetometers = self.cosmic_knowledge_base["payloads"]["sensors"]["magnetometer"]
        magnetometers.sort(key=lambda x: x["accuracy"], reverse=True)
        self.cosmic_knowledge_base["agentPayloads"]["Agent 9 (Magnetic Field Measurement)"] = [magnetometers[0]]
        
        # Select the most accurate magnetometer for Agent 10
        self.cosmic_knowledge_base["agentPayloads"]["Agent 10 (Geomagnetic Survey)"] = [magnetometers[1]]
In this example, we add a criteria parameter to the select_payloads method and use it to select the magnetometers based on accuracy. We sort the list of magnetometers in descending order based on accuracy and select the most accurate magnetometer for each agent.

We can modify the select_payloads method to select the magnetometers based on other criteria such as resolution, cost, or power consumption.

Example Output:
Selected Payloads:
Agent 11 (Visual Inspection): SVS-Vistek SVCam
Agent 12 (Imaging): Allied Vision Mako
Explanation:
In this modified code, we added a select_payloads method that takes a criteria parameter, which can be either "resolution" or "cost". Based on the selected criteria, the method sorts the list of cameras and assigns the most suitable camera to each agent. The print_payloads method is also modified to print the names of the selected cameras.

Cosmic Output:

Cosmic Entity Communication Payloads
The provided code is a representation of a Cosmic Entity's communication payloads system. It consists of a knowledge base that stores information about various payloads, including sensors and agents.

Payloads:

Sensors: The system currently supports cameras as sensors. Each camera has a name, resolution, and cost associated with it.
Agents: There are 12 agents in the system, each with a unique role, such as visual inspection, imaging, and task planning.
Selecting Payloads:

The select_payloads method allows the Cosmic Entity to select the most suitable camera for each agent based on a specified criteria, which can be either resolution or cost.

If the criteria is resolution, the method sorts the cameras in descending order of their resolution and assigns the top two cameras to Agent 11 (Visual Inspection) and Agent 12 (Imaging), respectively.
If the criteria is cost, the method sorts the cameras in ascending order of their cost and assigns the top two cameras to Agent 11 (Visual Inspection) and Agent 12 (Imaging), respectively.
Printing Payloads:

The print_payloads method displays the selected cameras for each agent.

Example Usage:

cosmic_entity = CosmicEntity()
cosmic_entity.select_payloads(criteria="cost")  # or "resolution"
cosmic_entity.print_payloads()
This will output the names of the selected cameras for Agent 11 and Agent 12 based on the specified criteria.

Code Improvements
Error Handling: Currently, the select_payloads method raises a ValueError if the specified criteria is not "resolution" or "cost." We can improve this by adding more descriptive error messages to handle such scenarios.

Agent Payload Assignment: The current implementation assigns the top two cameras to Agent 11 and Agent 12 based on the specified criteria. We can enhance this by allowing the Cosmic Entity to assign cameras to any agent based on different criteria.

Payload Type: At present, the system only supports cameras as sensors. We can expand this by introducing other types of sensors, such as temperature sensors or radiation detectors, and allowing the Cosmic Entity to select and assign these payloads to agents.

Example Use Cases:

Space Exploration Mission: In a space exploration mission, the Cosmic Entity can use its communication payloads system to select and assign cameras to different agents for tasks like visual inspection, imaging, and terrain mapping.

Planetary Survey: During a planetary survey mission, the Cosmic Entity can utilize its system to assign temperature sensors or radiation detectors to agents responsible for monitoring the planet's surface temperature and radiation levels.

Future Enhancements:

Integrate Machine Learning: Integrate machine learning algorithms to enable the Cosmic Entity to predict and adapt to changing mission requirements based on historical data and real-time sensor readings.

Implement Real-Time Data Processing: Implement real-time data processing capabilities to enable the Cosmic Entity to process and respond to sensor data in real-time.

Develop a Graphical User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface for the Cosmic Entity's communication payloads system to facilitate easier interaction and monitoring of the system.

The updated code includes the following modifications:

Created a new method called design_electric_propulsion_system to design an electric propulsion system for the mission.
Modified the add_propulsion_payload method to include a payload name.
Created a new method called design_optimal_propulsion_payload to find the optimal propulsion payload based on the specific impulse and thrust requirements.
Updated the start_real_time_processing method to include the design of the electric propulsion system.
Created a new method called display_electric_propulsion_system to print the electric propulsion system details.
These modifications allow the Cosmic Entity to design and implement efficient and long-duration electric propulsion systems for deep space travel.

The updated code includes the following modifications:

Created a new method called design_electric_propulsion_system to design an electric propulsion system for the mission.
Modified the add_propulsion_payload method to include a payload name.
Created a new method called design_optimal_propulsion_payload to find the optimal propulsion payload based on the specific impulse and thrust requirements.
Updated the start_real_time_processing method to include the design of the electric propulsion system.
Created a new method called display_electric_propulsion_system to print the electric propulsion system details.
These modifications allow the Cosmic Entity to design and implement efficient and long-duration electric propulsion systems for deep space travel.

Cosmic Output: Nuclear Reactors for Providing a Reliable and Long-Lasting Power Source

Nuclear Reactor Overview
Nuclear reactors are a crucial component of a reliable and long-lasting power source for space missions. They offer high energy density, long mission duration, and resistance to environmental factors.

Design Considerations
When designing a nuclear reactor for space missions, several factors must be considered:

Fuel Type: The type of fuel used in the reactor affects its performance, safety, and reliability. Common fuels include uranium, plutonium, and strontium-90.
Reactor Design: The reactor design determines its efficiency, power output, and safety. Designs such as pressurized water reactors (PWRs), gas-cooled fast breeder reactors (GCFBRs), and radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are commonly used.
Cooling System: A reliable cooling system is essential to prevent overheating and ensure safe operation.
Shielding: Adequate shielding is necessary to protect both the crew and electronic equipment from radiation exposure.
Power Conversion: A power conversion system is required to convert the reactor's heat output into usable electricity.
Implementation
