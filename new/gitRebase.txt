You
what is the pick thing?
Copilot
In the context of a Git interactive rebase, the term pick is used to indicate that you want to include a specific commit as it is in the new history you're creating. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the commands you might see in the rebase editor:

Interactive Rebase Commands
pick: Use the commit as it is. This is the default option.

reword: Use the commit, but edit the commit message.

edit: Use the commit, but stop after applying it, allowing you to make further changes.

squash: Meld the commit into the previous commit, combining their changes and commit messages.

fixup: Similar to squash, but keeps only the previous commit's message.

exec: Run a shell command.

break: Stop here and continue the rebase later.

drop: Remove the commit from the history.

label: Label the current HEAD with a name.

reset: Reset HEAD to a previously labeled commit.

merge: Create a merge commit.
